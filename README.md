# Code Challenges

What is this repo all about? This repo is readily available quick reference for myself and anyone else looking to practice some useful scripts on either Bash or Windows PowerShell. 

Why are you learning these skills?  Attackers may use scripts in several ways to carry out cyber attacks. For example, they may run scripts directly on a target computer or include them in PDF and Office documents that are emailed to the victim.

What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201? I learned a lot in 201, setting up VM servers to link our VS Code and pushing it to Git.  Im still learning this but the nuiances between the different scripting languages and how to properly write out the scripts using the respective script "grammar" rules. How to set up a virtual router using pfSense, proper ways to restore data and to effectively dispose of data, there is so much I've personally learned in this short amount of time.  I am STILL digesting the info but I am hungry for more!

What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why? While I enjoyed the labs more the Ops Challenge that I thought was cool was OPS Challenge 07 where we wrote a script to grep out specific system information.  It was my first time to see a script pull out targeted information and can see the usefulness where this would assist someone while troubleshooting. The Ops Challenge 13 was also fun because we were able to pull information from various sources within a selected domanin then have it pushed to a local txt file on the desktop.  Amazing!

How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace? Shell scripts can be used to automate routine tasks such as backups, system updates, user management, and monitoring. Shell scripts can be used to manipulate and process data, for example, to extract information from log files, format data for reporting, or convert data from one format to another.

What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time? It would be a little of each.  I want to keep them nice and simple. It helps me as I am still learning the structure while it still remaining effective to get the job done.  The more complicated we get the more chances we will develop errors over time requiring more script maintenance.  

What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next? To continue honing the balance between simplicity and functionality.
